PROJECT PROPOSAL.
About System
This is a simple GUI based application that is very easy to understand and use. It uses the Tkinter module
for the GUI. The user can address the order and view the total receipt of the items which displays a
receipt number and number of their food or drinks items with the total amount. It also has an extra
calculator feature for the users, whereby, the total bill of the customer includes tax and service charges
too. The design is so simple that the user won’t find any hindrance while working on it.
How the sales management system works?
A sales management system is a platform that helps the sales team reach its goals. Sales managers can
use this platform to track data, reduce admin tasks, and assign leads.
Problems identification and problem solving
 Stock level management and elimination of manual work
The sale software will give a clear visibility of primary, secondary and tertiary sales as a stock
report. It helps trace the stock level and makes the sale's man smart with the elimination of
manual paper and pen. Hence more being precise and liable to minimal errors.
 Real time sale person tracking 
One of the greatest problem in business is having no idea what your sales person is up-to, so
basically, the sale automation software solves the problem of tracking your sales person and
activities.
 Planning, execution and analyze market demands
Using the data collected from the marketing touch point, a sales tracking software incorporates
it and shows the sales trends of the previous month.
Furthermore, this will help in knowing what product is being bought more frequently (since its
on demand) and what product goes slower.
